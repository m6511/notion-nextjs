# Claude Code Instructions for notion-nextjs

When working on this project, you should maintain the Notion-based documentation using the workflow described below.

### âœ… For Every Codebase Change:

- Create feature branch: Always work on separate branches: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
- Review existing documentation: Before implementing, sync and review current Notion docs to understand what exists
- Consider documentation impact: For each change, assess if it needs documentation updates
- Update via API when needed: Use the documentation updater tool to maintain consistency
- Commit frequently: Make small, focused commits with concise messages
- Update docs and code together: Always commit both feature code and documentation updates in the same branch
- Keep documentation short and concise: Avoid unnecessary verbosity and keep in line with the existing structure. Consider to add a new page if the content is too long or complex.
- Remove unused code and keep the codebase clean: Regularly review and remove unused code to keep the library lean and efficient.

This workflow ensures clean git history and up-to-date documentation!
